TuinWolk
========
TuinWolk is intended to become a distributed backup solution powered by git. Its current state can be described as a brainfart among friends. That said, the general idea behind TuinWolk is open, please read the licence located in licence.md.

See the documentation files for a more thorough description of the ideas surrounding TuinWolk.

Although the documentation and (future) source code are open to the world, TuinfeesT's private cloud is not. If you have no clue what TuinfeesT is and do not know some of us personally, you're not welcome; set up your own cloud using the source code ;)
